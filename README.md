# TerraTransfer #
A safer alternative to overwriting Terraria saves.

# Downloading #
I will be proving *PreBuilt* version of the app incase you do not want to build it yourself.
You may check them out at the [Releases](https://github.com/Maddox-Werts/TerraTransfer/releases) section.

# Building #
To build this app you will need a few things:

- G++ ( Compiler )
- SDL2 ( Window framework )
- SDL2_image
- SDL2_ttf

After that please run the following command inside of the __TeraTransfer__ folder:
```Bash
mkdir build
cd build
mkdir custom
cd ..

```
